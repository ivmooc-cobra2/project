These are tables from the Social Security Administration containing a history of all registered names from 1880 - 2014

names_unique = all names registered without a count and noting sex (e.g. Kelly, M, Kelly F)

names_ambigendrous = all names registered with counts included so that one may infer whether a name is predominately male or female

names_preponderance = ambigendrous names are chopped so that only the dominant usage is included (e.g. "kelly, F")
